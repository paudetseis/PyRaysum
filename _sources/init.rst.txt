Installation
------------

Dependencies
++++++++++++

``PyRaysum`` requires a modern Fortran compiler (e.g., `gfortran <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_, ifort). In addition, the following packages are required:

- `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_
- `obspy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki>`_

By  default, both ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib`` are installed as dependencies
of ``obspy``.

Conda environment
+++++++++++++++++

We recommend creating a custom
`conda environment <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_
where ``pyraysum`` can be installed along with its dependencies:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda create -n prs python=3.8 fortran-compiler obspy pandas -c conda-forge

Activate the newly created environment:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   conda activate prs

Installing latest version from PyPi
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*This option is not available at this time*

Installing development version from source
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Clone the repository:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/PyRaysum.git
   cd PyRaysum

- Install using ``pip``:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install .

Installing the Fortran binaries
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

After installing ``PyRaysum``, you need to compile and install the ``Raysum`` binaries by running the provided ``install-raysum`` script. Check out the helper page for the available options:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   install-raysum -h

Running the script without arguments will attempt to install ``Raysum`` to default paths and fortran compiler (these are contained in the ``$PATH`` and ``$FC`` environment variables). If you installed ``PyRaysum`` using ``conda`` (and the ``fortran-compiler`` package), you can safely ignore the options and type ``install-raysum`` in the terminal. To call the script with options (which take precedence over any default ``conda`` environment variables), you would specify:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	install-raysum --path=/path/to/bin --fcompiler=gfortran

Note that the ``--path`` option requires the full, absolute path. If you specify a path in one of the root directories, you may have to run ``install-raysum`` with super-user privileges, for example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

	sudo install-raysym --path=/usr/bin


Usage
-----

Jupyter Notebooks
+++++++++++++++++

Included in this package is a set of Jupyter Notebooks (see Table of Content),
which give examples on how to call the various routines and obtain plane wave
seismograms and receiver functions.
The Notebooks describe how to reproduce published examples of synthetic data
from `Porter et al. (2011) <https://doi.org/10.1130/L126.1>`_.


After ``pyraysum`` is installed, these notebooks can be locally installed
(i.e., in a local folder ``Notebooks``) from the package
by typing in a ``python`` window:

.. sourcecode :: python

   from pyraysum import doc
   doc.install_doc(path='Notebooks')

To run the notebooks you will have to further install ``jupyter``.
From the terminal, type:

.. sourcecode :: bash

   conda install jupyter

Followed by:

.. sourcecode :: bash

   cd Notebooks
   jupyter notebook

You can then save the notebooks as ``python`` scripts,
check out the model files and set up your own examples.

Seismic velocity models
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Loading a model file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the Jupiter notebooks you will find a folder named ``models`` where a
few examples are provided. The header of the file ``model_Porter2011_dip.txt``
looks like:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ################################################
    #

    #   modeling teleseismic body wave propagation
    #   through stratified media.

    ################################################

The header is not required and can be deleted when you become familiar
with the various definitions. Note that the code requires 10 entries per
layer, regardless of whether or not the variable is required (it will
simply be ignored if it's not).

Let us break down each line, depending on how you set ``Layer flag``:

Layer flag set to ``1``
*************************

This flag represents a case where the layer is isotropic.

- Set column 0 (``Thickness``), column 1 (``Density``), column 2 (``P-wave velocity``), column 3 (``S-wave velocity``) and column 4 (as ``iso``)

- Set columns 5 to 7 to ``0.`` or any other numerical value - they will be ignored by the software.

- Set columns 8 and 9 to the strike and dip angles of the layer in degrees (0. by default)

Layer flag set to ``0``
*************************

This flag represents a transversely isotropic layer. We adhere with
the definition in
`Porter et al. (2011) <https://doi.org/10.1130/L126.1>`_,
whereby the parameter :math:`\eta`, which describes the curvature of the
velocity “ellipsoid” between the :math:`V_P`-fast and :math:`V_P`-slow axes, varies
with anisotropy for a 2-:math:`\psi` model and is not fixed.

The column 5 in this case sets the percent anisotropy for both
:math:`V_P` and :math:`V_S` (equal anisotropy for both :math:`V_P` and :math:`V_S`) and is the only
instance where this column is required.

- Set all columns to the required numerical value (and column 4 to ``1``)

Creating a ``Model`` class instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Models can also be defined on the fly in Python using lists that contain
the relevant information as input into an instance of the
:class:`~pyraysum.prs.Model` class.

Examples
********

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> from pyraysum import Model

- Define a two-layer model with isotropic properties and no dip

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> thick = [20000., 0.]       # Second layer thickness is irrelevant
   >>> rho = [2800., 3300.]
   >>> vp = [4600., 6000.]
   >>> vs = [2600., 3600.]
   >>> model = Model(thick, rho, vp, vs)

- Define a two-layer model with transversely isotropic crust over isotropic half-space

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> # Example using a single line
   >>> model = Model([20000., 0.], [2800., 3300.], [4000., 6000.], [2600., 3600.], [0, 1], [5., 0], [30., 0], [10., 0], [0., 0.], [0., 0.])

.. note::

   In this example all entries for the first layer are required. Here the anisotropy is
   set to 5% (i.e., fast axis of symmetry; for slow axis the user should input ``-5.``)
   and the axis of symmetry has a trend of 30 degrees and a plunge of 10 degrees.

Plotting a model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a :class:`~pyraysum.prs.Model` is created (from either method detailed above), the ``model`` instance has methods to generate plots of the seismic velocity model that it contains. The simplest option is to use the ``plot()`` method, which will produce a figure with two subplots: 1) a stair-case plot of the seismic velocity and density profiles, and 2) a layered (stratigraphic-like) representation of the model. These subplots can be created separately using the ``plot_profile()`` and ``plot_layers()`` methods directly.

Example
*******

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> from pyraysum import Model

- Define a four-layer model with a mix of isotropic and transverse isotopic properties. 

.. note::

	Note here we do not specify the trend and plunge of the symmetry axis since this information is not (yet) used in the plot. Default values will apply (``0.`` for both parameters).

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> thick = [15000., 20000., 15000.,  0.]
   >>> rho = [2750.,  2800., 3300., 3250.]
   >>> vp = [4300., 4600., 5600., 6000.]
   >>> vs = [2400., 2600., 3300., 3600.]
   >>> isoflg = [1, 1, 0, 1]
   >>> ani = [0., 0., 5., 0.]
   >>> model = Model(thick, rho, vp, vs, isoflg=isoflg, ani=ani)

   >>> model.plot()

.. figure:: ../pyraysum/examples/picture/Figure_4layer_model.png
   :align: center


Basic usage
+++++++++++

These examples are extracted from the :func:`~pyraysum.prs.run_prs` function.

For anisotropic velocity models, users need to specify the back-azimuth
value in degrees. Furthermore, the default type of the incoming
teleseismic body wave is ``'P'`` for compressional wave. Other options are
``'SV'`` or ``'SH'`` for vertically-polarized shear wave or
horizontally-polarized shear wave, respectively.
Wave modes cannot be mixed.


Modeling a single event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> from pyraysum import prs, Model
   >>> # Define two-layer model with isotropic crust over isotropic half-space
   >>> model = Model([30000., 0], [2800., 3300.], [6000., 8000.], [3600., 4500.])
   >>> slow = 0.06     # s/km
   >>> baz = 0.
   >>> npts = 1500
   >>> dt = 0.025      # s
   >>> streamlist = prs.run_prs(model, baz, slow, npts=npts, dt=dt)

   >>> type(streamlist[0])
   <class 'obspy.core.stream.Stream'>
   >>> print(st)

Filter streams using a lowpass filter and plot using the ``obspy`` function.

Modeling receiver functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Receiver functions can only be calculated for component rotation equals to '1' (R-T-Z system)
or '2' (P-SV-SH system). There are two ways to calculate receiver functions - either directly
from the function ``run_prs`` with the argument ``rf=True`` (default is False), or after
you have obtained the 3-component seismograms from ``run_prs`` with ``rot=1`` or ``rot=2``.

Let's first define a simple 2-layer model:

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> from pyraysum import prs, Model
   >>> # Define two-layer model with isotropic crust over isotropic half-space
   >>> model = Model([30000., 0], [2800., 3300.], [6000., 8000.], [3600., 4500.])
   >>> slow = 0.06     # s/km
   >>> baz = 0.
   >>> npts = 1500
   >>> dt = 0.025      # s

Method 1
********

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> streamlist = prs.run_prs(model, baz, slow, npts=npts, dt=dt, rot=1, rf=True)
   
   >>> print(streamlist.rfs[0])
   2 Trace(s) in Stream:
   .synt..RFR | 2020-12-12T21:43:39.788002Z - 2020-12-12T21:44:17.263002Z | 40.0 Hz, 1500 samples
   .synt..RFT | 2020-12-12T21:43:39.788682Z - 2020-12-12T21:44:17.263682Z | 40.0 Hz, 1500 samples

   >>> streamlist.filter('rfs', 'lowpass', freq=1., corners=2, zerophase=True)
   >>> streamlist.rfs[0].plot()

Method 2
********

.. sourcecode:: python

   >>> streamlist = prs.run_prs(model, baz, slow, npts=npts, dt=dt, rot=1)
   >>> rflist = streamlist.calculate_rfs()

   >>> print(rflist[0])
   2 Trace(s) in Stream:
   .synt..RFR | 2020-12-12T21:44:13.539484Z - 2020-12-12T21:44:51.014484Z | 40.0 Hz, 1500 samples
   .synt..RFT | 2020-12-12T21:44:13.540241Z - 2020-12-12T21:44:51.015241Z | 40.0 Hz, 1500 samples

   >>> [rf.filter('lowpass', freq=1., corners=2, zerophase=True) for rf in rflist]
   >>> rflist[0].plot()

Both methods will produce the same receiver function figure. Note that the zero lag time is the middle of the time axis. You can also notice wrap-around effects (weak arrivals before zero-lag time). Be careful when selecting time-sampling parameters when running ``Raysum``.
