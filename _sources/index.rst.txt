Documentation
=============

``PyRaysum`` is a Python wrapper around the Fortran software ``Raysum``, originally developed by `Andrew Frederiksen <https://umanitoba.ca/faculties/environment/departments/geo_sciences/research_facilities/AndrewFrederiksen.html>`_ in collaboration with `Michael Bostock <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/people/michaelbostock>`_. This program generates sets of ray-theoretical seismograms for an incident plane wave (teleseismic approximation) for models consisting of a stack of layers with planar (but possibly non-parallel and dipping) interfaces, allowing the flexibility of adding seismic anisotropy in the layers. Incident P and S waves are supported. The code include methods to process the synthetic seismograms for receiver function calculation and for plotting. 

``PyRaysum`` is bundled with a trimmed version of the original Fortran software and provides a script to compile and install Raysum, as well as functions to interact with the software and generate plots of models and seismograms. Common computational workflows are covered in the ``Jupyter`` notebooks bundled with this package.
